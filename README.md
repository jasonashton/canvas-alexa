# Official GitHub of the Alexa Canvas plugin
---
This is intended to add a Skill to the Amazon Alexa Library for the Canvas Learning Management System

## How to use this
Currently the software does not support OAuth so you'll need to create a canvas log in token and put it in the file 'auth-token.txt'. The skill can then be set up in the Alexa skills kit

### What to ask
>Alexa, ask Canvas for my most recent grades
>Alexa, ask Canvas for my most recent grades in Algorithms
